DOOM Level Viewer

This is a JavaScript translation of Coder Space's DOOM Level Viewer written in Python.

Their playlist "Recreating DOOM in Python" is available here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi77irUVkDasNAYQPr3N8nVcJLQAlANva&si=8ZmOuPErMA6IlV5E

The level viewer works best on Chrome with WAD files such as "DOOM", "DOOM1", "DOOM2", although, it still has visual glitches which may not be present in the Python version. These include misaligned textures or drawing so called "flats" where wall textures should be drawn.
"doom.html" is a one-file download for all the code necessary to run the level viewer.
